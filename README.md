NBA Player Performance Prediction

Overview:

This project aims to predict NBA player performance for upcoming 
games based on various player statistics and contextual factors. It 
utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical player data 
and make predictions about future player performance.

Features:

Predict player projected statistics such as Minutes played, Three pointers, 
Rebounds, points and home vs away. 
Use historical player data for training and validation.
Utilize machine learning models for prediction.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.)
NBA player data (e.g., player game statistics, injury status, game context)
Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/hgerner19/nba-player-performance-prediction.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Prepare the NBA player data (historical player statistics, injury status, game context, etc.).
Train the machine learning model using historical data.
Make predictions for upcoming games using the trained model.
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.
Fine-tune the model as needed based on evaluation results.
